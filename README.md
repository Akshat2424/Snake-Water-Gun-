This is the simple chance based game in which when you select 1,2 and 3 snake,water and gun will be assigned to you respectively.
Now the computer will select randomly its choice from these three.
If both(you and computer) have same thing then it will be tie, but if one choose snake over water or gun over snake and water over gun then the he/she will win over computer otherwise he/she will lose.
